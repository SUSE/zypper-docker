# This image has to be out-dated so tests can work on it. That's why we are
# installing an old version of a package that we know that has received
# updates.
RUN zypper -n in --repo OSS ruby2.1

# Downgrande openssl to have even more CVEs
# TODO: figure out what we could do fore 42.3
#RUN zypper -n in --oldpackage openssl-1.0.1i-2.1.4.x86_64

# testing purposes.
